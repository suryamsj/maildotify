**Maildotify** is a simple yet powerful tool to generate multiple email variations from a single Gmail address by strategically inserting dots (.) in different positions. Since Gmail ignores dots in email addresses, all generated variations will still deliver to your original inbox. This makes it perfect for signing up for different services while keeping your inbox organized and maintaining privacy.

## Features

- **Generate Unique Email Variations**: Create multiple versions of your Gmail address for different platforms.
- **Gmail Compatibility**: All variations point to your original inbox, ensuring seamless delivery.
- **Easy to Use**: Just input your Gmail address and click "Generate" to get started.
- **Privacy-Friendly**: Avoid cluttering your inbox by using unique email variations for different accounts.
- **No Registration Required**: Use your existing Gmail account without creating anything new.

## How It Works

1. Enter your Gmail address (e.g., example@gmail.com).
2. Click the "Generate" button.
3. Maildotify will produce email variations like e.xample@gmail.com, ex.amp.le@gmail.com, and more.
4. Use these variations confidently, knowing they all route to your original inbox.
